## Second project of the Data Science Bootcamp @WBS Coding School
### Data Cleaning and Visualization

---

As our second project we had to clean some data from "Eniac" - a company selling electronics.
Since we learned SQL beforehand, we now had to learn several new things to do in Python:

- Cleaning the data with pandas
- Getting a grasp on how to present this data with Seaborn and matplotlib

Firsly struggling with the deadline, we finally presented our stuff in a short presentation to our class.
I was kind of proud to automate some things like .info(), .describe() .sample() in a function i called "overview", 
which felt cool to maybe easier handle/investigate future upcoming dataframes. 
Really astonishing what can be done with matplotlib/seaborn and also what feedback i got for my coding so far.
